# Task

A large CSV file contains values of a parameter read off cars' engines during a race. The data comes on channels with 1 microsecond frequency.

Each row contains the name of a driver, parameter value and the timestamp, for example:

```
Alonzo,4.32,12313123232132
Alonzo,4.87,12313123232133
Verstrappen",4.11,12313123232132
```

Write a programme that computes an average value of the parameter for every driver. 
Consider efficient use of computer memory. Use Java, Scala, C# or F#.
