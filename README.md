# Race Car Coding Challenge

## Task

A large CSV file contains values of a parameter read off cars' engines during a race. The data comes on channels with 1 microsecond frequency. Each row contains the name of a driver, parameter value and the timestamp. 

Write a programme that computes an average value of the parameter for every driver and prints top three positions. Consider efficient use of computer memory.

## Example

For input:

```
Alonzo,4.32,12313123232132
Alonzo,4.88,12313123232133
Verstrappen,4.11,12313123232132
```

the output should be:

```
Alonzo,4.60
Verstrappen,4.11
```

## Deliverables

* Your solution must be submitted in Java, Scala, C# or F#
* You should include instructions on how to compile, test and run your code
* You should explain any assumptions that you make
